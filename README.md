# dtest
It's a sub-project for Dynamic Test, instead its smake to cmake.

# build
- Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/ProtossGenius/dtest.git
cd dtest
./udpate # you need python3 to run it
#and then, you you maybe want mkdir an build dir 
cmake $dtest_path
make
make install

```

- Windows & mac

you should compile the rely-libs and put them to the 'third\_part' dir
I think there will some update for those os later.(I know, but I don't work on those system...)
